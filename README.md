Two Reasons To Use i:
1. You need to access the value at that index.
2. You need to access a range of value or an older value or see what index you are at.

If not use i. For-Of loop is a better option

This for loop
~~~
for (let i=0; i<numbers.length; i++) {
num = numbers[i]
}
~~~
Is equal this for-of loop
~~~
for (const num of numbers) {
}
~~~
